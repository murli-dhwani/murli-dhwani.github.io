[Murli](https://www.shivbabas.org/what-is-murli) is the recorded teachings spoken by the incorporeal supreme soul through his corporeal medium. Murli gives us an understanding of Godâ€™s reality. Not just an understanding but a real experience of it. The Murli is a daily food for thought. It is mainly composed of spiritual churning, knowledge (Gyan), divine values, and our story of the world cycle, which inspires us on how to think, live, transform ourselves from within, and serve the world. It is not chanting, repeating, or learning by rote, but is a realization, an experience of this godly knowledge, and bringing the shrimat (God's elevated advice) in our day-to-day life.

# Types of Murli
Murlis are basically of 2 types: **Sakar Murli** and **Avyakt Murli**

## Sakar Murli

[Sakar Murlis](https://www.shivbabas.org/sakar-murli-bapdada-madhuban) are original versions of Shiv Baba our Supreme Teacher, as initially and actually spoken by Him through his corporeal medium Prajapita Brahma from 1951 till 18 Jan 1969. These precious teachings have been preserved through the years, translated to other languages.

## Avyakt Murli

Prajapita Brahma became avyakt (left the body) and hence Shiv baba (God) along with Brahma's soul will now enter in one corporeal medium to speak Murli or knowledge. The part was changed in January 1969. [AVYAKT MURLI](https://www.shivbabas.org/avyakt-bapdada-murli) are the versions spoken from 1969 till 2015 through the medium of Dadi Gulzar. Older Avyakt murlis are gems of raw knowledge of the human world, human nature and the entire creation (universe).

## Advantages of reading and churning Murli

* MURLI - is food, medicine, shield, and a weapon for the mind, so studying Murli is a 'life-saver'. Murli is music for the soul. A soothing balm.
* For fast restoration to perfect health, its most important to eliminate waste thoughts. The best therapy for this: Fill yourself rather saturate your mind, churning this Knowledge that there is no
 margin left for Maya (the vices) or negative / waste / impure thoughts to enter your mind.
* Positive/powerful/pure thoughts obtained from Baba's Murli are the seeds we sow for an elevated destiny.
* Murlis are unfiltered and unadulterated teachings of the superior soul with his energy. So by reading murli daily, we can experience God Consciousness.
* The advantage of listening to it in a gathering of like-minded and interested people is the powerful vibrations that will benefit anyone who diligently studies and implements the teachings in their daily lives.
