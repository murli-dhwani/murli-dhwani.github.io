[Murli](https://www.shivbabas.org/what-is-murli) is the recorded teachings spoken by the incorporeal `supreme soul` through his corporeal medium. These are the sweetest words of true raw knowledge. Murli is the link of the soul with Supreme Soul. Murli gives us an understanding of God’s reality. Murli gives us an understanding of `God’s reality`. Not just an understanding but a real experience of it. The Murli is a daily `food for thought`.

It is mainly composed of `spiritual churning`, `knowledge (Gyan)`, `divine values`, and our `story of the world cycle`, which inspires us on how to `think`, `live`, `transform ourselves from within`, and `serve the world`. It is not chanting, repeating, or learning by rote, but is a `realization`, an experience of this godly knowledge, and bringing the **shrimat (God's elevated advice) in our day-to-day life**.

# Types of Murli
Murlis are basically of 2 types: `Sakar Murli` and `Avyakt Murli`


## Sakar Murli

[Sakar Murlis](https://www.shivbabas.org/sakar-murli-bapdada-madhuban) are `original versions of Shiv Baba`, our Supreme Teacher, as initially and actually spoken by him through his corporeal medium `Prajapita Brahma` from `1951` till `18 Jan 1969`. These precious teachings have been preserved through the years and translated into other languages.

## Avyakt Murli

Prajapita Brahma became avyakt (left the body), and hence Shiv baba (God), along with Brahma's soul, will now enter in one corporeal medium to speak Murli or knowledge. The part was changed in January 1969. [Avyakt Murli](https://www.shivbabas.org/avyakt-bapdada-murli) are the versions spoken from `1969 till 2015` through the medium of `Dadi Gulzar`. Older Avyakt Murlis are gems of raw knowledge of the `human world`, `human nature`, and the entire `creation (universe)`. **They impart practical knowledge on applying gyan every day**.

## Advantages of reading and churning Murli

* Murli is `food`, `medicine`, `shield`, and  `weapon` for the `mind`, so studying Murli is a 'life-saver.' **Murli is music for the soul**. A soothing balm.
* For `fast restoration` to perfect health, it is most important to `eliminate waste thoughts`. The best therapy for this is to fill yourself rather than saturate your mind, churning this Knowledge that there is no margin left for `Maya (the vices)` or `negative / waste / impure thoughts` to enter your mind.
* Positive/powerful/pure thoughts obtained from Baba's Murli are the seeds we sow for an elevated destiny.
* Murlis are `unfiltered` and `unadulterated` teachings of the superior soul with `his energy`. So by reading murli daily, we can `experience God's Consciousness`.
* The advantage of listening to it in a gathering of `like-minded` and interested people is the `powerful vibrations` that will benefit anyone who `diligently studies` and `implements` the teachings in their daily lives.
